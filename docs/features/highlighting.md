## Overview
On any weapon which can highlight, you will see this indicator to let you know it has that feature:

Note some weapons have the feature natively, a few require an ornament, some lose highlighting when an ornament is applied, and others need a specific scope option. This clarification is also shown on the weapon info.

We have this data from a community effort organised by Sovokh, with contributions from Outlandre, Gilly, Longshotbob, Moons,  Andromeda, TomCruiseMissle, Colgrove, Zugashii, Odo, Spookytm, 0, Circadian Wolf, 7Tempest, Hotmiilk, Yoshizle, ultraclocked#0, chansey.01, Cheese Forever, Snerv, the people in the D2 Foundry Discord, and others, this project wouldn't be completed without you.

**Reed's Regret** has *very faint* highlighting. In an outdoor setting, you may not even see it working. In a very dark area like Abyss, though, you can see it does in fact highlight.
